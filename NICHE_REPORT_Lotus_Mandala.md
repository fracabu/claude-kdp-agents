## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**MARKET VERDICT: GO** (Confidence: 78%)

The Lotus Flower Mandala coloring book niche demonstrates strong fundamentals across both US and Italian markets.

**Royalty Formula:**
```
Net Royalty = (List Price x 0.60) - Printing Cost
            = ($9.99 x 0.60) - $1.35
            = $5.99 - $1.35
            = $4.64 per sale
```

**Monthly Revenue Projections by BSR:**

| BSR Target | Est. Monthly Sales | Revenue Formula | Monthly Revenue |

- **Total Annual (US):** $3,880.48

### ITALIAN MARKET (9.99 EUR List Price)

**Royalty Formula:**
```
Net Royalty = (List Price x 0.60) - Printing Cost
            = (9.99 EUR x 0.60) - 1.28 EUR
            = 5.99 EUR - 1.28 EUR
            = 4.71 EUR per sale (~$5.15 USD)
```

**Monthly Revenue Projections by BSR:**

| BSR Target | Est. Monthly Sales | Revenue Formula | Monthly Revenue (EUR) |

### D. Keyword Byte Calculation Reference

**Backend Keyword Byte Limits:**
- Each keyword slot: 50 bytes maximum
- ASCII characters: 1 byte per character
- Spaces count as 1 byte
- Special characters (accents, umlauts): may count as 2 bytes

**Example:**
- "lotus coloring book adult stress relief" = 42 bytes
- l-o-t-u-s (5) + space (1) + c-o-l-o-r-i-n-g (8) + space (1) + b-o-o-k (4) + space (1) + a-d-u-l-t (5) + space (1) + s-t-r-e-s-s (6) + space (1) + r-e-l-i-e-f (6) = 39 characters = 42 bytes
