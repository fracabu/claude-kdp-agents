### KEYWORD OPTIMIZATION NOTES

**Title Construction Formula:**
- [Specific Flower] + Mandala Coloring Book for Adults
- [Number] + [Adjective] + [Flower Type] + Mandala Designs

- No duplicate words across slots
- Include long-tail variations
- Mix broad + specific terms
- Target gift occasions (birthday, Christmas, Mother's Day)
- Include demographic (women, men, teens)
- Feature format benefits (large print, single sided)

**Italian Keyword Considerations:**
- "Antistress" is key Italian search term (not direct translation)
- "Mindfulness" often kept in English (trendy wellness term)
- "Pagine a facciata singola" = single-sided pages (important USP)
